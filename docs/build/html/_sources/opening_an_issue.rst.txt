Opening An Issue/Requesting A Site
==================================

If your’re planning to open an issue for the script or ask for a new
feature or anything that requires opening an Issue, then please do keep
these things in mind.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you’re going to report an issue, then please run the script again
with the “-v or –verbose” argument. It should generate a file in the
same directory, with the name “Error Log.log”. Copy that log file’s data
and post it on a `Gist <https://gist.github.com/>`__ and share that
gist’s link while reporting the issue here. Make sure you **EDIT OUT
YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD**, if supplied within the command.

If you don’t include the verbose log, there are chances it’ll take time
to fix the issue(s) you’re having. Please follow this syntax :

**Command You Gave** : What was the command that you used to invoke the
script?

**Expected Behaviour** : After giving the above command, what did you
expect shoud’ve happened?

**Actual Behaviour** : What actually happened?

**Link To Gist** : As mentioned earlier, post the error log in a gist
and share that link here.

P.S : Just attaching a screenshot will NOT tell or anyone else what
happened behind the scenes. So, Error Log is mandatory.

Suggesting A Feature
--------------------

If you’re here to make suggestions, please follow the basic syntax to
post a request :

**Subject** : Something that briefly tells us about the feature.

**Long Explanation** : Describe in details what you want and how you
want.

This should be enough, but it’ll be great if you can add more ;)
