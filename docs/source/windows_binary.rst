Windows Binary
==============

It is recommended that windows users use this binary to save both, your
head and time from installing all the dependencies.

You need to download and install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__
and make sure it is in your Windows path (watch out for the tick box
during install).

If you already have it, then you can download this binary and start
using the script right off the bat : \* ``Binary (x86)`` : `Click
Here <https://github.com/Xonshiz/comic-dl/releases/latest>`__

**``NOTE:``** This is a ``COMMAND LINE TOOL`` and will ``NOT`` work when
you double click it. So, download this ``.exe`` file and put it in some
folder (Not in windows or some other restricted folder) and then hold
down ``SHIFT KEY`` and right click anywhere on the screen and select
“``Open Command Window here``”. It’ll open a CMD window for you. Now,
you need to execute it and pass arguments to it like:

::

   comic_dl.exe -i "https://readcomicsonline.ru/comic/irredeemable-omnibus-2012"

Read which argument does what in `List of
Arguments <#list-of-arguments>`__ section.
